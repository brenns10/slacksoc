# To users: you'll need to fill in a lot of blanks in here. Anything you need to
# fill in is left in UPPER CASE so you can see it. Usually there will be a
# comment above it describing how to fill it out. You may also just want to
# eliminate some of the plugin entries if you don't need them.
#
# To developers: core plugins are listed in this configuration file. Your
# core plugin should have its configuration documented here. You should paste
# this documentation into the plugins/plugin.go docstring and keep it up to
# date.

# Go into "Custom Integrations" and create a bot!
# You can provide this token in the configuration file, or via the SLACK_TOKEN
# environment variable.

    # This is a list of objects that define a response. (As of now) only one
    # response can ever fire at a time--the first match.
    #
    # * trigger is a regular expression that uses the syntax of RE2:
    #   https://golang.org/s/re2syntax
    #   + For case insensitive matching, put (?i) at the front of your regex
    #   + The regular expression need only match within the string, not
    #     necessarily the whole string.
    #   + Use ^ and $ to match beginning/end of the string
    #   + If you have trouble with YAML messing up your regex, check this:

    # * replies - A list. One is randomly selected and sent to the channel on
    #   match.
    #
    # * reacts - A list. One is randomly selected and added to the message on
    #   match. Don't include colons. This will happen in addition to the reply.
